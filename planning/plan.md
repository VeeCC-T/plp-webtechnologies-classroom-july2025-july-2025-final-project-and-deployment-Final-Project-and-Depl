# Multipage Website Plan

**Project purpose**  
Personal portfolio and small project showcase that highlights web and healthcare-related projects, contact info, and a gallery of sample work.

**Target pages (3-5)**  
1. Home (index.html) — hero, short intro, featured projects, CTA  
2. About (about.html) — bio, skills, education  
3. Services / Projects (services.html) — list of services or project cards  
4. Gallery (gallery.html) — images or screenshots grid  
5. Contact (contact.html) — contact form and social links  

**Page layouts (short sketches)**  
- Header (site name/logo) with navigation (Home / About / Services / Gallery / Contact)  
- Footer (copyright, small nav, social links)  
- Consistent header and footer on every page.  
- Mobile-first design. Main nav collapses to a hamburger on small screens.  

**Navigation map**  
- Header nav links to each page at top level.  
- Home includes links to About and Services sections for quick navigation.  
- Contact page reachable from footer and header.  

**Accessibility notes**  
- Use semantic HTML: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<article>`  
- Provide `alt` text for all images and `label` elements for form fields  
- Ensure color contrast and keyboard-accessible navigation  

**Deliverables**  
- Folder structure and code in repo  
- `README.md` with project info and live URL  
- Live site deployed (Vercel)
